# @axonlabs/core

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- In previous versions hardcoded config option came back to the Axon core instance but it had some bugs and it wouldn't work.
  So the logic of config loading in core edited and the problem fixed and now users can config the Axon core in hardcode mode without config file.
  NOTE: Config file support is still ok.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- NeuronContainer designed and developed to help developer using Dependency Containers easily and also Dependency injection feature for Axon core improved but it still an experimental feature.
